# Welcome to routify.js

[routify.js](routify.html) (yes, it's literate code!) is the most unintrusive, and yet most powerful, client-side routing system for
Single Page Applications (SPas) out there.
It's written in modern ES6 Javascript, has fallback support, and it does as little as possible
while being very powerful.

## Pure Javascript

You don't need to use fancy frameworks: routify.js will work out with existing
SPAs without intruding in the app itself.

## Existing systems

routify.js integrates with the following libraries:

* lit-element. routify.js provides two mixins which will enable routing for your main page
and any other pages in no time. Batteries included!
