# Welcome to routify.js

[routify.js](https://mobily-enterprises.github.io/routify/routify.html) (yes, it's literate code!) is the most unintrusive, and yet most powerful, client-side routing system for Single Page Applications (SPas) out there.
It's written in modern ES6 Javascript, has fallback support, and it does as little as possible while being very powerful.

It supports sub-routes, each one with different fallbacks.

## Pure Javascript

You don't need to use fancy frameworks: routify.js will work out with existing SPAs without intruding in the app itself.

It will work with any framework -- or even [no framework at all](https://mobily-enterprises.github.io/routify/guides/01-straight-html.html), with straight HTML files.

It also integrates with the following libraries:

* lit-element. routify.js provides two mixins which will enable routing for your main page
and any other pages in no time. Batteries included!

* _(more to come)_

See the [official routify.js](https://mobily-enterprises.github.io/routify/) documentation
